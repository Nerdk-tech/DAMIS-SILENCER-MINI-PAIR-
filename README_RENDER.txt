FULL Render-ready package - merged with your original Telexwa base.

What I did:
- Copied your original Ask.zip files into /bot/
- Added server.js (Express) that:
  - Requires ./bot/index.js on startup (most Telexwa bases initialize on require)
  - Exposes /pair (calls bot/pairing.js) and /status endpoints
  - Serves the dark UI at / (public/index.html)
- Wrote bot/pairing.js which tries to detect and call common exported pairing helpers.
- public/index.html includes a status panel and pairing UI.

Important notes & next steps:
- I tried to auto-detect pairing helpers, but every Telexwa/baileys base is different.
- If pairing doesn't work automatically, open bot/pairing.js and replace the fallback logic
  with the exact function call to your bot's pairing routine (for example, call the socket requestPairingCode or exported helper).
- Deploy to Render with start command: `node server.js`
- If the bot fails to run on startup, check the logs on Render and adjust paths or required env variables.

Files included at root:
- server.js
- package.json
- public/index.html (UI)
